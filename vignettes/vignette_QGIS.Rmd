# 1 Vignette Info

Most common landscape metrics are calculated on a raster-basis. However, sometimes landscape information come along in vector-formats. For the calculation of landscape metrics, one must perform a vector-to-raster-transformation often resulting in a loss of information. In **VLSM** we implemented various landscape metrics based on vector data in `R`. However, sometimes it is easier to process data with only few clicks using a desktop GIS. Therefore, we created compatible R scripts being accessible in the open-source desktop GIS `QGIS`.
In the following, a quick manual on how to use these functions in `QGIS`. If you want to use these functions via `R`, please refer to [here](https://github.com/raff-k/VLSM/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_R.pdf).


# 2 Packages and Software Utilities

The open-source desktop GIS `QGIS` enabele the possibility to integrate R-scripts. However, `QGIS` does not except the standard `.R`-format, instead we developped R-scripts which are compartible to `QGIS` and can easily be loaded in with only few clicks. You can find the **VLSM** R-scripts for `QGIS` [here](https://github.com/raff-k/VLSM/blob/master/R_QGIS).

We tested our implementation on Windows with the following software and packages:
* Before integrating `R` into `QGIS`, one must have installed `R` ([download-page](https://cran.r-project.org/)). Our implementation was tested using *R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20) -- "Eggshell Igloo"*. Furthermore, we recommend to install the necessairy packages [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html), [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html), [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html), [link2GI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/link2GI/index.html), [rgrass7](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgrass7/index.html), [RSAGA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSAGA/index.html), [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html), and of course [VLSM](https://github.com/raff-k/VLSM) via `R`. 
* **QGIS 3.6 Noosa**: We recommend `QGIS`> 3.x which can easily be installed by the [OSGeo-installer](https://live.osgeo.org/de/download.html). In `QGIS` one must enable the option for R-processing, first. An comprehensive instruction can be found [here](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/training_manual/processing/r_intro.html), or [here](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/273623/r-scripts-in-qgis-3-0). It may be that `R` is not visible or included in the setting menu. If that is the case the `Processing R Provider` must installed as plug-in (see [here](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/273623/r-scripts-in-qgis-3-0) for help). 

*Note:* One can set `R's` library directory in QGIS. Installing necessairy packages may be better done inside `R`.


When the setup of the setting was successfull, the `QGIS` desktop should look similiar to the following screenshot:
 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# LOAD REQUIRED LIBRARIES
pacman::p_load(VLSM, magick)

# LOAD THE DATA OF THE PACKAGE:
data(VLSM_QGIS, package = "VLSM")  
  
image_Intro <- magick::image_read(VLSM_QGIS$image_intro)
image_Mesh <- magick::image_read(VLSM_QGIS$image_mesh)
image_Urban_Sprawl <- magick::image_read(VLSM_QGIS$image_ffe)

# ![](sf_xfig.png)
```


```{R, messages = FALSE, invisible = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="QGIS setting to access R functions", out.width = '100%'}
plot(image_Intro)

```



# 3 Calculation of Landscape Metrics

We use Corine Land Cover (CLC) data, which are in detailed explained in the [R-vignette](https://github.com/raff-k/VLSM/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_R.pdf) of this package.

## 3.1 Example 1: Effective Mesh Size

The *effective mesh size* is calculated with the tool _Mesh_. The output delivers a table with the corresponding mesh sizes [ha].

```{r, messages = FALSE, invisible = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Calculation of Effective Mesh Size in QGIS", out.width = '100%'} 
plot(image_Mesh)
```

## 3.2 Example 2: Urban Sprawl

The *Urban Sprawl* is calculated with the tool _Urban Sprawl_. The output delivers a table with the corresponding degree of urban sprawl [%], and a geometry showing the grid lines, which were used for calculation.

```{r, messages = FALSE, echo=FALSE, invisible = TRUE, fig.cap="Calculation of Urban Sprawl in QGIS", out.width = '100%'}
plot(image_Urban_Sprawl)
```
